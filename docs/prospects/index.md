# Prospects & Todos

This area collects short-term and long-term items: feature ideas, maintenance
tasks, experiments, and research topics. It's organized into smaller focused
pages (todos, roadmap, backlog) so contributors can pick work at the right
granularity.

Pages in this section:

- `todos.md` — prioritized small-to-medium actionable tasks
- `roadmap.md` — higher-level quarterly/major milestones
- `backlog.md` — collection of research/spikes and low-priority ideas

Guidelines

- Keep entries short and concrete. For todos, include: context, suggested
  owner (optional), and expected outcome.
- Use kebab-case filenames and concise headings.
- Move items into an issue or PR when work starts; this space is for planning
  and discovery.
