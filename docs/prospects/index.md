# Prospects & Todos

This area collects short-term and long-term items: feature ideas, maintenance
tasks, experiments, and research topics. To avoid crowding the `prospects/`
directory we group related concepts into a small set of consolidated pages:

- `setup.md` — interactive setup and environment/configuration tasks
- `pipeline.md` — processing pipeline architecture, staged pipeline and related work
- `ci-tests.md` — CI skeleton, heavy-tests guidance and self-hosted runner notes
- `backlog.md` — research items and low-priority ideas

Guidelines

- Keep entries short and concrete. For todos, include: context, suggested
  owner (optional), and expected outcome.
- Use kebab-case filenames and concise headings.
- Move items into an issue or PR when work starts; this space is for planning
  and discovery.

Use the links above to find the detailed plans and consolidated todos for each
area.
