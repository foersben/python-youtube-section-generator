# Backlog & Research (long-term ideas)

This page contains larger research topics, spikes, and low-priority feature
ideas. Use this as a dumping ground for ideas that may later be promoted to the
roadmap or converted to actionable todos.

- Investigate phonetic correction datasets for German/English transcription
- Explore RAP (retrieval-augmented polishing) to improve title quality
- Research more efficient embedding models for CPU-only use
- Experiment with on-device quantized models and lazy-loading strategies
- Evaluate local fine-tuning for domain-specific transcript correction
