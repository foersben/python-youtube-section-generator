# Web App API

Endpoints provided by the Flask web app (see `src/web_app.py`):

- `POST /generate-sections` — generate sections for a given video or transcript
- `POST /download-sections` — download the generated sections as text

Request/response formats and examples are maintained in the source docstrings; use the Flask test client for manual verification during development.
