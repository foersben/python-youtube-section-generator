# Scripts

Scripts live under `scripts/` and are organized by purpose:

- `scripts/tools` — installation and helper tools (download_model.sh, setup_cpu_rag.sh)
- `scripts/verify` — verification helpers (detect_gpu.py, verify_local_llm.py)
- `scripts/dev` — developer helpers
- `scripts/obsolete` — archived one-off scripts

Most scripts are developer-facing. For test-related scripts converted into pytest tests, see `tests/scripts/`.
